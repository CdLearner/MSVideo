# jquery.touch: Touch gestures for jQuery

Adds a bunch of touch gesture events to jQuery (with mouse support!)

Requires jQuery 1.7+. Tested on Android (latest), iOS (latest), Firefox, Chrome, Safari, and IE7-10.

## Usage

Load it after jQuery:

```html
<script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-x.x.x.min.js"></script>
<script src="jquery.touch.min.js"></script>
```

Use `enableTouch()` to add touch gesture events to a selector:

```js
var foo = $('.foo');
foo.enableTouch();
```

Bind stuff like you normally would:

```js
foo
	.on('tap', function(e) { alert('Tapped!'); })
	.on('doubleTap', function(e) { alert('DOUBLE tapped!'); })
	.on('swipeLeft', function(e) { alert('Swiped left!'); });
```

And that's about it.

## Supported Gesture Events

- tap
- doubleTap
- dragStart
- drag
- dragEnd
- swipe
- swipeUp
- swipeDown
- swipeLeft
- swipeRight
- tapAndHold

## Config

`enableTouch()` can optionally take a config to override some or all of the following defaults:

```js
foo.enableTouch({
	useMouse:			true,	// If true, mouse clicks and movements will also trigger
								// touch events
	dragThreshold:		10,		// Distance from tap to register a drag (lower = more
								// sensitive, higher = less sensitive)
	dragDelay: 			200,	// Time to wait before registering a drag (needs to be high 
								// enough to not interfere with scrolling)
	swipeThreshold:		30,		// Distance from tap to register a swipe (lower = more 
								// sensitive, higher = less sensitive)
	tapDelay:			250,	// Delay between taps
	tapAndHoldDelay:	750		// Time to wait before triggering "tapAndHold"
});
```

## Gesture Data

Almost every event passes back an object with data on the triggering gesture. For example:

```js
foo
	.on('tap', function(e, info) { 
		alert('Tapped at ' + info.x + ', ' + info.y + '!');
	});
```

And here's what you'll find in that object for each event:

### tap, doubleTap, tapAndHold, dragStart, drag

- x: X position (relative to document)
- y: Y position  (relative to document)
- ex: X position (relative to element)
- ey: Y position (relative to element)

### dragEnd

- start: x/y/ex/ey of starting point
- end: x/y/ex/ey of end point
- distance: Distance dragged (in pixels)
- duration: Time spent dragging (in ms)
- velocity: Dragging velocity (in pixels/ms)

### swipe, swipeUp, swipeDown, swipeLeft, swipeRight

- distance: Distance swiped (in pixels)
- duration: Time spent swiping (in ms)
- velocity: Swiping velocity (in pixels/ms)

## The Future

- Multitouch gestures (pinch, zoom, etc.)
- More demos
